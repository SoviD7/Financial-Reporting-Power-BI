### Insights:
#### 1. Debt Ratio: 
i) Constant Value (0.44): The debt ratio remains constant at 0.44 over the four-year period.<br>
ii)Insight: The company maintains a consistent proportion of total liabilities relative to total assets. A constant debt ratio suggests stability in the company's capital structure.

#### 2. Current Ratio:
i) Constant Value (0.44): Similar to the debt ratio, the current ratio remains constant at 0.44 across the four years.<br>
ii) Insight: The current assets are 44% of current liabilities consistently. This may indicate a stable ability to cover short-term obligations.

#### 3. Working Capital:
i) Gradual Decline (7053 to 7049): Working capital shows a gradual decline from 7053 to 7049 over the four years.<br>
ii) Insight: The company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with its current assets has slightly decreased over the period. Monitoring working capital trends is important for assessing liquidity.

#### 4. Asset to Equity Ratio:
i) Constant Value (3.1): The asset to equity ratio remains constant at 3.1 throughout the four years.<br>
ii) Insight: The company maintains a consistent relationship between total assets and owner's equity. This ratio indicates the extent to which assets are financed by equity.

#### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio:
i) Constant Value (1.35): The debt to equity ratio remains constant at 1.35 across all four years.<br>
ii) Insight: The company sustains a steady balance between debt and equity in its capital structure. This ratio suggests that for every unit of equity, there is 1.35 units of debt.

#### Overall Insights:

i) Stable Capital Structure: The company exhibits stability in its capital structure, as indicated by constant debt-related ratios (debt ratio, current ratio, debt to equity ratio) over the four years.

ii) Working Capital Decline: The gradual decline in working capital suggests a slight reduction in the company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with current assets. Further investigation is recommended to understand the reasons behind this trend.

iii)Consistent Financial Leverage: The asset to equity ratio and debt to equity ratio show consistent levels of financial leverage, indicating a maintained balance between equity and debt financing.
